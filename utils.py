'''
Four thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Republic verges on collapse. DARTH \
MALAK, last surviving apprentice of the Dark Lord Revan, has unleashed an invincible Sith armada upon \
an unsuspecting galaxy.

Crushing all resistance, Malak's war of conquest has left the Jedi Order scattered and vulnerable as \
countless Knights fall in battle, and many more swear allegiance to the new Sith Master.

In the skies above the Outer Rim world of Taris, a Jedi battle fleet engages the forces of Darth Malak \
in a desperate effort to halt the Sith's galactic domination....
